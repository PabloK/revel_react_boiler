    * app.conf, the main configuration file for the application, which contains standard configuration parameters
    * routes, the routes definition file.
    * environment.json, custom configuration which can be overriden with environment variables use the
      packages/configurationmanager to get these in the application.


messages

public

    Resources stored in the public directory are static assets that are served directly by the Web server. Typically it is split into three standard sub-directories for images, CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.
